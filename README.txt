Requisite Files: movie_loader.py, fresh_tomatoes.py

Directions: 	 Ensure fresh_tomatoes.py is in the same directory as movie_loader.py, or that fresh_tomatoes.py file location is in sys.path.
	    	 Then simply run movie_loader.py.
Notes:		 Added hover-text to highlight big-name actors in each movie. Also renamed main header.
